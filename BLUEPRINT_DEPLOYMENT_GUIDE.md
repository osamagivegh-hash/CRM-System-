# CRM System Blueprint Deployment on Render

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy your Multi-Tenant CRM System as a **single blueprint** on Render, which will automatically deploy both the frontend and backend services together with proper cross-service communication.

## What is a Blueprint?
A blueprint in Render is a configuration file (`render.yaml`) that defines multiple services and their relationships. When you deploy a blueprint, Render creates all the services simultaneously and configures their environment variables to reference each other automatically.

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository with your CRM code
- Render.com account
- The `render.yaml` file in your repository root

## Step 1: Deploy from Blueprint

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub Repository
1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Create New Blueprint**
   - Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select your CRM repository

3. **Deploy Blueprint**
   - Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
   - Review the services that will be created:
     - `crm-backend` (Node.js web service)
     - `crm-frontend` (Static site)
     - `crm-database` (MongoDB database)
   - Click "Apply"

### Option B: Deploy from URL
1. In Render Dashboard, click "New +" → "Blueprint"
2. Select "Deploy from URL"
3. Enter your repository URL: `https://github.com/osamagivegh-hash/CRM-System-`
4. Click "Apply"

## Step 2: Automatic Configuration

The blueprint will automatically:

### Backend Service (`crm-backend`)
- **Environment**: Node.js
- **Build Command**: `cd backend && npm install`
- **Start Command**: `cd backend && npm start`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `PORT=10000`
  - `MONGODB_URI` (auto-configured from database)
  - `JWT_SECRET` (auto-generated)
  - `JWT_EXPIRE=7d`
  - `BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12`
  - `FRONTEND_URL` (auto-configured from frontend service)

### Frontend Service (`crm-frontend`)
- **Environment**: Static Site
- **Build Command**: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `frontend/build`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `REACT_APP_API_URL` (auto-configured from backend service)

### Database (`crm-database`)
- **Type**: MongoDB
- **Plan**: Free
- **Database Name**: `crm_production`

## Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Deployment Status**
   - Go to your blueprint in Render Dashboard
   - Monitor the deployment progress for each service
   - Check logs if any service fails to deploy

2. **Service URLs**
   - Backend: `https://crm-backend.onrender.com`
   - Frontend: `https://crm-frontend.onrender.com`
   - Database: Internal connection only

## Step 4: Create Super Admin

Once deployment is complete:

1. **Access Backend Logs**
   - Go to `crm-backend` service
   - Click on "Logs" tab

2. **Create Super Admin via API**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://crm-backend.onrender.com/api/super-admin/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "email": "admin@yourcompany.com",
       "password": "your-secure-password",
       "name": "Super Admin"
     }'
   ```

   Or use the backend logs to run:
   ```bash
   node create-super-admin.js
   ```

## Step 5: Access Your Application

1. **Frontend URL**
   - Visit your frontend URL: `https://crm-frontend.onrender.com`
   - The frontend will automatically connect to the backend

2. **Backend API**
   - API Base URL: `https://crm-backend.onrender.com/api`
   - Health Check: `https://crm-backend.onrender.com/api/health`

## Blueprint Benefits

### Automatic Cross-Service Communication
- Frontend automatically knows the backend URL
- Backend automatically knows the frontend URL
- Database connection is automatically configured

### Single Deployment
- Deploy all services with one click
- All services are managed together
- Easy to update and redeploy

### Environment Variable Management
- No manual configuration of service URLs
- Automatic secret generation
- Secure cross-service references

## Troubleshooting Blueprint Deployment

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   ```bash
   # Check build logs in Render dashboard
   # Common fixes:
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Verify build commands are correct
   ```

2. **Service Communication Issues**
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables are set correctly
   # Check that services can reach each other
   # Ensure CORS is properly configured
   ```

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check MongoDB connection string
   # Verify database service is running
   # Check network connectivity
   ```

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Service Logs**
   - Go to each service in Render Dashboard
   - Click "Logs" to see real-time logs
   - Look for error messages

2. **Test API Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test health endpoint
   curl https://crm-backend.onrender.com/api/health
   
   # Test database connection
   curl https://crm-backend.onrender.com/api/health
   ```

3. **Verify Environment Variables**
   - Check that all required environment variables are set
   - Verify cross-service references are working

## Updating Your Blueprint

### Making Changes
1. **Update Code**
   - Make changes to your code
   - Commit and push to GitHub

2. **Redeploy**
   - Go to your blueprint in Render Dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - Or enable auto-deploy for automatic updates

### Adding New Services
1. **Update render.yaml**
   - Add new service definitions
   - Update environment variable references

2. **Redeploy Blueprint**
   - Render will create new services
   - Existing services will be updated

## Production Considerations

### Performance
- **Upgrade Plans**: Consider upgrading from free tier for better performance
- **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas M10+ for production workloads
- **CDN**: Enable Render's CDN for static assets

### Security
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data
- **HTTPS**: All Render services use HTTPS by default
- **Rate Limiting**: Already configured in your backend

### Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Use `/api/health` endpoint
- **Logs**: Monitor application logs
- **Uptime**: Set up external monitoring

## Cost Optimization

### Free Tier Limitations
- Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Limited build minutes per month
- Database connection limits

### Upgrade Strategy
- Monitor usage patterns
- Upgrade services as needed
- Consider reserved instances for consistent performance
